###Additional report
For the custom report, I chose to display customers and their respective division. I chose to have SQL do the work for this. This SQL query retrieves data from two tables, customers and first_level_divisions, by performing an inner join based on the relationship between their Division_ID columns. The query returns the Customer_Name from the customers table and the Division from the first_level_divisions table for each record that matches the join condition.

###How to run the program
As the program starts, a login screen is presented. The user will be required to have a valid username and password that matches information in a mysql database. This program requires java 11 and has not been tested with any other jvm.
